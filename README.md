# GPT-Language Model Implementation
This repository contains a basic implementation of a GPT-style language model built using PyTorch. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of natural language processing (NLP), including tokenization, self-attention, and transformer architecture. The model is trained on text data and is capable of generating new text based on a given prompt.
## Features
✨ Customizable hyperparameters (e.g., embedding size, number of layers, batch size).

🛠️ Implementation of key components like:

🔑 Self-attention mechanism.

🧠 Multi-head attention.

🚀 Feedforward layers.

⚖️ Layer normalization.

🧩 Text tokenization and decoding.

📈 Model training and text generation.
## Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:

🐍 Python 3.8 or higher

🔥 PyTorch 1.11.0 or higher

🖥️ GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)

You can install the necessary libraries with the following command:
```
pip install torch
```
## Files
📄 oz.txt: Training dataset containing the text corpus (e.g., text from "The Wizard of Oz").

📦 model-01.pkl: Trained model file (generated after training).

🖊️ Main Python script: Contains the full implementation of the model, including training and generation logic.
## Running the Code
🧩 Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
📥 Add the training data (oz.txt) to the same directory as the script.
▶️ Run the script:
```
python your_script_name.py
```
📊 During training, the script will display:

📉 Training and validation loss.

📝 Generated text samples.
## Code Overview
## Key Functions and Classes
🔄 encoder and decoder: Convert text to integers and back to text.

📋 get_batch: Fetches batches of data for training and validation.

📊 estimate_loss: Evaluates training and validation loss.

🧩 Head, MultiHeadAttention, FeedForward, and Block: Core components of the transformer architecture.

🧠 GPTLanguageModel: The main model class.

✍️ generate: Generates text given a prompt.
## Training Process
📚 Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.

🤖 Uses a transformer architecture with multiple heads and layers.

🛠️ Optimizes the model using AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss.

## Text Generation

After training, the model can generate text based on a given prompt. For example:
```
prompt = 'Hello! Can you see me?'
context = torch.tensor(encoder(prompt), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
generated_chars = decoder(m.generate(context.unsqueeze(0), max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist())
print(generated_chars)
```
## Customization
You can modify hyperparameters like:

📦 ****batch_size: Number of samples per batch.

📏 ****block_size: Maximum sequence length.

📊 n_embd, n_head, ****n_layer: Embedding size, number of heads, and layers in the transformer.

💧 ****dropout: Dropout rate to prevent overfitting.

## Saving and Loading the Model

💾 The trained model is saved as a .pkl file:
```
with open('model-01.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
print('Model saved')
```
📂 To load the model:
```
with open('model-01.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
print('Model loaded successfully')
```
